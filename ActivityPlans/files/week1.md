# Activity Plan for Week 1

## What you have to do all weeks

We expect you to work for 13 hours every week on this module, as follows:

 * 2 hours in the Lab UG4 (Computer Science building) **12-2pm on Mondays.**

 * 2 hours attending in person lectures (Old Gym LG12) **4-6pm on Thursdays**

   Trust us, the above above information is more reliable than the
   information provided by the University.

 * In some weeks, however, *when explicitly announced*, there will be an assessed test in the Lab UG04 at a time compatible with your timetable.

 * 9 hours studying handouts, watching recorded lectures about them, and doing unassessed but mandatory exercises, and recording your performance on [Canvas](https://canvas.bham.ac.uk/courses/56295).

## What you have to do this week

### Check the GitLab repository

 * [GitLab](https://git.cs.bham.ac.uk/mhe/afp-learning/-/tree/main)

### Attend the UG04 Lab in Computer Science at 12-2pm

No previous preparation needed.

 * There will be a lecture,
 * You will also get exercises to do during the lab.

### Important

 * The first lab is particularly crucial. Make sure you don't miss it.

### Read handouts for this week

Deadline *Thursday noon*.

 * [Introduction](/LectureNotes/files/introduction.lagda.md)
 * [Resources](/LectureNotes/files/resources.md)

### Watch videos for this week

The videos are not mandatory if you can manage to understand the handouts.
The lectures will repeat what is in the videos, but not everything. This is because we will both explain and discuss the material of the handouts, and sometimes do things that are not in the handouts or the videos.

 * [Introduction 1](https://bham.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=863d96f5-cd50-4d41-8dfe-ae2901381768) (21min)

Total 2hrs.

### Attend the Thursday 4-6pm lecture at Old Gym LG12

You **must** read the handout carefully enough before the lecture to be able to fully participate of the discussions.

### Complete the lab exercises by the end of this week

 * And report your performance on Cavas.

 * We will provide solutions in a file, some of them explained in videos.

### If you are lost in Week 1

 * Check the [Campus Map](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/contact/directions/index.aspx).
 * After all this has been a long pandemic and we don't expect you to be fully acquainted with the campus buildings even if you are in year 3 or 4 of your studies.

### If you are lost in Week 1

In a different sense.

 * Use [Teams](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/team/19%3aR61tJG-pMjV401vTB2LyPJrPPpwhLzKQb2XbdwC9R5s1%40thread.tacv2/conversations?groupId=61980408-0833-4885-91fa-2ecde6c7c03f&tenantId=b024cacf-dede-4241-a15c-3c97d553e9f3) to reach us.
