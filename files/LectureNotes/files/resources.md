# Resources

## Agda installation

We offer you a complete Agda environment

 * in the UG04 Lab machines, either in person of [remotely](remote-lab.md) and
 * as a Jupyter [Notebook accessible via a browser](https://jupyter.apps.okd.aws.cs.bham.ac.uk),

so that you don't need to install it in your own machine. However, unfortunately, Jupyter won't work well, because both Jupyter and Browsers capture emacs/Agda keybindings. So you more likely prefer remote access to the lab. We also explain how to do this in the first [lab lecture](lab1.lagda.md).

We are using Agda 2.6.2, the latest version at the time of writing. There is a standard library, but we are not going to use it, at least not to begin with.

You may still wish to [install Agda in your own machine](https://agda.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started/installation.html), but we are not able to provide support, although you are welcome to ask questions on [Teams](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/team/19%3aR61tJG-pMjV401vTB2LyPJrPPpwhLzKQb2XbdwC9R5s1%40thread.tacv2/conversations?groupId=61980408-0833-4885-91fa-2ecde6c7c03f&tenantId=b024cacf-dede-4241-a15c-3c97d553e9f3).
It is much easier to install on Linux and Mac, and possible on Windows (one option is to use the Window Subsystem Linux (WSL) and use the Linux installation guide).

## Emacs resources

Agda has a very nice interactive environment for writing programs which works in the text editor [emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/).

 * [Install emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/download.html)
 * [A guided tour of Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/tour/index.html)
 * [Emacs manual](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/index.html)
 * [Emacs reference card](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/refcards/pdf/refcard.pdf)
 * [A tutorial introduction to emacs](https://www2.lib.uchicago.edu/keith/tcl-course/emacs-tutorial.html)

The [Getting Started](https://plfa.github.io/GettingStarted/) section of the online book
[Programming Language Foundations in Agda](https://plfa.github.io/) has a nice installation guide as well as a summary of emacs commands.

## Visual Studio Code

There is [plugin for Agda support](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=banacorn.agda-mode) available on the Visual Studio Marketplace. We haven't tried it.
